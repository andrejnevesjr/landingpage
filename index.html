                <h2>What Is a Front&#8209;End Developer&#63;</h2>
                <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
                    CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them
                    directly. </p>
                <p>The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create
                    the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of
                    how the field is developing.</p>

            <h2>Main Tools</h2>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It
                defines
                the meaning and
                structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
                appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation
                of a document
                written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how
                elements
                should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming
                language with
                first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a
                prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
                imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>
